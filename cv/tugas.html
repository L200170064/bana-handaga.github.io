<h2>Gender & Age Classification using OpenCV Deep Learning ( C++/Python )</h2>
<p>Ideally, Age Prediction should be approached as a Regression problem since we are expecting a real number as the output. However, estimating age accurately using regression is challenging. Even humans cannot accurately predict the age based on looking at a person. However, we have an idea of whether they are in their 20s or in their 30s. Because of this reason, it is wise to frame this problem as a classification problem where we try to estimate the age group the person is in. For example, age in the range of 0-2 is a single class, 4-6 is another class and so on. </p>
